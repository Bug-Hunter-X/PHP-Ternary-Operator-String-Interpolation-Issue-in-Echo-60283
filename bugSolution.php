The solution involves properly concatenating the strings.  The ternary operator should be used to select the correct string, and this string should then be concatenated to the base string.

```php
<?php
$name = 'World';
$greeting = 'Hello';

echo $greeting . " ". ($name == 'World' ? $name . "!" : "Guest!");
?>
```

This corrected code will output the expected result, "Hello World!", and handles the conditional string interpolation correctly. The corrected code uses proper concatenation to combine strings.
