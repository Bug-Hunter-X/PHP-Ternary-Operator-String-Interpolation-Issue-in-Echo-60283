This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to using the ternary operator within an echo statement.  The issue arises when attempting to embed a variable inside a string using the ternary operator without proper concatenation.

```php
<?php
$name = 'World';
$greeting = 'Hello';

echo "{$greeting} " . ($name == 'World' ? "{$name}!" : "Guest!");
?>
```

In this scenario, the expected output is "Hello World!". However, if the ternary operator isn't used correctly it may output "Hello {$name}!" or even produce a parse error. This happens because the variable isn't properly interpolated into the string within the ternary's conditional expression.
